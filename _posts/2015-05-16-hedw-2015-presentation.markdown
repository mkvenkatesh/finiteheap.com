I did my first ever conference presentation last month at the
[Higher Education Data Warehouse](http://hedw.org) (HEDW)
conference. HEDW conference was held this year between April 19-22 in
Normal, Illinois. The conference was held at a hotel but it was only
few minutes away from Illinois State University. I was the only
presenter from Arizona State University among 50 or so presenters from
various higher education institutions. There were lot of folks this
year. I don't know the official count but it *seemed* liked there were
more than **500** people.

My presentation was on [ASU Analytics SharePoint UI
Customization](http://hedw.org/hedwpresentation/asu-analytics-sharepoint-ui-customization/),
where I talked about how we customized our new Analytics portal built
using SharePoint 2013. The slides are available in the link above only
for HEDW members. You can become a HEDW member if you have a **.edu**
email address. I also provided step by step instructions on
customizing SharePoint for their own institutions and provided the
entire code and instructions to the attendees. I'll create a separate
blog post that talks about the customization of SharePoint and how to
create a custom theme with more elaborate details than what you can
get from the slides.

My presentation was at the end of the day so I was pretty much forced
to be nervous all day, but the turnout wasn't what I was expecting. It
was less than I imagined, about 15 people I believe, but that probably
made it a lot better since it was easier to deal with a smaller
crowd. After the first few minutes I lost all my nervousness and felt
really comfortable speaking. It was scheduled for an hour but I had
almost 10 minutes left at the end of my presentation and had enough
time to take questions. All in all I consider it a success for my
first conference presentation.

Here's a sneak peek at one of the slides from the presentation.

I really enjoyed most of the presentations and met lot of people. I
got to see what other institutions does when it comes to Data
Warehouse, Reporting and Analytics and Data Governance. You get to see
new products and processes deployed at other Universities and their
success stories (no one wants to talk about their failures). Data
Governance and Cloud solutions were the big themes this year. The
conference was exhausting. There were fours presentations going on
simultaneously almost every hour from 8AM to 5PM. Even though it was
busy for the four days I was there, I took some time to tour the ISU
campus with flowers in full bloom and walk around downtown and also
take a really long hike at the Constitution Trail. It was a really
beautiful small mid-western college town and with the weather being
awesome, the trip was memorable.
