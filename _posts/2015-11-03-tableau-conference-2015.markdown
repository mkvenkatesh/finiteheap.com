## 10,000 Attendees ##

The 8th annual Tableau conference was held between Oct 19-23, 2015 in
Las Vegas, Nevada. MGM Grand was chosen as the venue and it was
fabulous. **10,000** people registered for the conference and it was
sold out. It was one giant Vegas party. I don't know if all Vegas
conferences are like this, but man I had a wonderful time, probably
the best work conference I've ever been to.

## Open Bar, Food & Sessions ##

There was open bar literally every few feet during welcome reception,
block party (yes, I'll get to that), hackathon, keynotes etc. There
was unlimited food and snacks all over the conference venues most of
the time and it was amazing. Apart from free alcohol and food, meeting
different people from variety of industries was one of the best part
of the conference.

There were *tons* of sessions and I had to spend a minimum of 20-30
minutes going over the schedule to pick a session to attend to for
each slot. One of the sessions I went to had Netflix engineers present
on their analytics and reporting infrastructure and I captured the
slide below which shows the teams data usage and it's insane - 20 peta
bytes! And this is probably just a sliver compared to what other teams
within Netflix might have.

## Data Night Out ##

The second night of the conference, Tableau threw a huge block
party. They blocked the entire Fremont street and had unlimited free
food and alcohol with two stages for multiple live bands throughout
the night. They also had zip lines running through the street although
that was only for speakers and other guests. They shuttled everyone
that could come from each of the hotels around the conference to
Fremont and shuttled us back out. The event was called **Data Night
Out** and it was beautiful. Oh boy, that night was fun.

## Keynotes ##

Lets talk about the keynotes. All the keynotes took place in the Grand
Arena which is freaking huge and has a capacity for 17,000 people and
this is inside the MGM Grand hotel. Here are the folks that did
keynote each day;

* **Daniel Pink**
* **Neil Degrasse Tyson**
* **Sir Ken Robinson**

Read that list again and tell me you didn't want to be there. Just to
hear these people talk was worth the conference price even though it
had nothing to do with Tableau or software or computers. Daniel Pink
gave an amazing talk on workplace motivation. Dr.Tyson gave a talk
about astrophysics and movies and it was one of the most entertaining
talk that I've been to. During Tyson's talk we were given a choice to
have either a beer or cocktail before we entered the arena which was a
pleasant surprise. Dr.Tyson wanted it to be a Vegas style keynote so
he requested this arrangement! And finally Sir Ken Robinson gave a
humorous yet somber talk on education and the current school
system. It was a real treat to listen to these amazing speakers
supported by a large crowd in this massive venue.

## Yeeehaw? ##

There was a hackathon that I participated in, an IronViz championship
was going on one of the days and there were so many other smaller
events that I couldn't even start to cover in this post. All in all
this was really fun conference and I'm glad that I got the opportunity
to head up there. If I get a similar opportunity next time I wouldn't
miss it. Next one is in **Austin**, Texas.
