I'm Venkatesh Mandalapa, the author of this website. My main interests
are in computer science and programming and this site will mostly be
about them. There are other areas I'm interested in as well like
finance, economy, hiking, reading etc., that I might write about.

My Github is at [mkvenkatesh](https://github.com/mkvenkatesh) and you
can contact me at <root@finiteheap.com>.
