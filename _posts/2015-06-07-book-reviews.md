I've been writing book reviews in this blog for a few months now. I
mainly do that to solidify the things I've read by recalling them and
writing them out here. I think I remember the story or the facts of a
novel or non-fiction book better and for longer if I write about
it. And it also helps me to develop writing skills, taking raw
thoughts and forming cohesive ideas and laying them out on paper or
bytes - which I see as the main function of maintaining a blog anyway.

But lately I've been backed up with writing reviews for the books I've
already read. I'm reading almost 2-3 books a month now and I just
can't find the time anymore to write about it. By the moment I get
some time to write blog posts I'm usually a month or so away from when
I finished a book and my recall function fails miserably.

Instead, I've decided to not write book reviews anymore unless I read
something life changing or books that spawn great ideas in my head
that needs to be written down for my own sake. Doing this leaves me to
read books at a comfortable pace and not worry about getting caught up
with writing a review for it.

I use Goodreads so if anyone is interested to see my book activity
it's here: [Goodreads Profile](http://www.goodreads.com/mkvenkatesh)
