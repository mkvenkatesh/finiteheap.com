In my teens, I was obsessed with mystery novels. I was not a voracious
reader or anything back then but from what little I read I was into
Agatha Christie, Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys and few others. I discovered
Sherlock Holmes collection and I found them extremely interesting and
leaps and bound better than any of the mystery novels I was reading
when I was a kid. I read few of Doyle's works but not all and it left
a lasting impression upon me during my years to come. I even named my
dog after Doyle's character, Watson. I'm his Sherlock Holmes.

So upon getting my new Kindle (which I love!) and finding that some of
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's collection were free download for Kindle
users, I planned to read rest of his works. I got
[The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes](http://amzn.com/B00L01GHAA) straight
out of the Kindle store and decided to give it a try to see if I would
still like it.

There are 11 short stories in the memoirs and each one is a fairly
quick read. Overall I was a little bit disappointed. What I found as
highly intelligent and fascinating in my childhood doesn't hold true
anymore, at least for some of the short stories. I only found 2 of the
11 stories, The Naval Treaty & The Final Problem, to be some what
enjoyable and intriguing. I think the phenomenally well done
[Sherlock Holmes TV show](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/) might
have had a negative effect on me in reading the Classic works. I
really *love* the TV show so the stories in this book, as much
as I wanted it to be awesome, didn't hold up to my expectations.

I never thought Professor James Moriarty, the arch enemy of Holmes,
would be first introduced and killed in a single short story! I almost
expected it to be a volume onto itself and not to mention Doyle
decides to kill Holmes character at the end of this same story as
well, "The Final Problem". But fret not, Holmes gets revived by Doyle
in a different novel because of
[public backlash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle#Sherlock_Holmes)
in early 1900's for killing the famous fictional character. I rate it
3 stars but I'm not going to give up reading rest of Doyle's works. I
understand these are short stories so they feel rushed and not so
thrilling. I'm going to try reading the longer novels and see how I
like it.
