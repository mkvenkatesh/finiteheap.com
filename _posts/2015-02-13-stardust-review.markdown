I'm part of a book club, to be more precise a *teen* book club, in our
local library. **Stardust** was picked for the month of January so I
had to read this book. Initially I was dismissive of this book since
I'm not that into fantasy/fairy tales and not to mention the book
appeared and sounded like it's meant for little kids. I watched the
movie a long time ago and I had a vague idea of liking that
movie. Since I didn't remember anything from the movie and the book
seemed rather small I figured I'd read it in couple days to make it
for the club meeting.

This was my first **Neil Gaiman** book and I was
pleasantly surprised to have loved reading it. My last two reads were
non-fiction so this was a much easier read. I struggled a bit in the
beginning with all the new words that I didn't know and since this
wasn't a kindle version I had to look up word definitions in my phone
every single time so my read rate was crippling. I think after a point
it was a lot easier with my improvement in vocabulary.

There was lot of magical stuff, kings and queens, witches and
harridans, creatures of different sizes, shapes and forms, and strange
worlds. I really loved all the illustrations in the book. It helped a
lot with understanding certain aspects of the story. There wasn't much
room for character development as things were moving really fast and I
kind of liked it but at the same time I almost wished the book was
longer with more to the story since it was a such a lovely read. I
rate it 5 stars and I'm definitely looking forward to reading more
books written by Neil Gaiman.
