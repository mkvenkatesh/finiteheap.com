I own a Kindle Fire 7'' (7th generation). It looks like this;

If you are ever in doubt about your Kindle version, the easiest way to check is
to log in to your Amazon account and go to [Manage Your Content and
Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html#/home/devices/1) and select
`Devices` to look at all your registered devices. That page shows which Kindle
version you have.

Now, the problem I faced a few months ago was that my Kindle battery was
draining faster than it should. I always keep my Kindle in airplane mode and I
don't use anything in my fancy Kindle except to read books (D'oh). You would
think the battery would last a long time with this combination. And it did for
almost 3 years but suddenly I started to see that the battery was draining
faster than expected. It was draining so fast that with a full charge it wasn't
lasting more than a day or two. I used to get it for than a week before. Very
puzzling. I though the battery life was coming to an end.

I fiddled with various settings but nothing worked until I found a random forum
post online suggesting SD card might be the issue. I did have a small 4GB mini
SD Card for extended storage in my Kindle. I pulled it out and viola, the
battery was back to normal again. Thank you random internet forum post.
